<p>Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by interactive visual interfaces. It combines automatic and visual analysis methods with a tight coupling through human interaction in order to gain knowledge from data. Visual analytics integrates science and technology from many disciplines. Visualisation is the center of the system used to communicate data values an also to monitor processes in other disciplines such as data management and data mining. Following are the disciplines that contribute towards visual analytics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Management</li>
  <li>Data Mining</li>
  <li>Spatio-temporal Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Perception and Cognition</li>
  <li>Infrastructure</li>
  <li>Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data management</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>important</strong>&nbsp;because the&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>&nbsp;your organization creates is a very valuable resource. There are certain obstacles that come from large datasets. Certain issues have to be considered while studying such data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heterogeneity of data sources.</li>
  <li>Different data types.</li>
  <li>Data streams.</li>
  <li>Working under pressure.</li>
  <li>Time consuming activities</li>
</ul>

<p>In most of the applications, heterogeneous data needs to be integrated before visual or automatic analysis methods can be applied. So, the ﬁrst step is to preprocess and transform the data to derive different representations.</p>

<p>After preprocessing it is time to choose which analysis methods needs to be applied (visual/automatic analysis methods). If an automated analysis is used ﬁrst, data mining methods are applied to generate models of the original data. Now the models have to be refined and evaluated. Visualizations allows the analysts to interact with the automatic methods by modifying parameters or using different algorithms. Switching between visual and automatic methods is an important step for the Visual Analytics process.
  The user should generate a hypothesis using automated analysis if visual data analysis is performed first. User interaction with the visualization is needed to find important information. Findings in the visualizations can be used to steer model building in the automatic analysis. In summary, in the Visual Analytics Process knowledge can be gained from visualization, automatic analysis, as well as the preceding interactions between visualizations, models, and the human analysts.
