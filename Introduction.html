      <h1 >Research Topic</h1>
      <p>Software security is about engineering software so that software continues to function correctly under malicious attacks. To develop secure software, it is important for software engineers to understand different vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited by the attackers.<br>
        <br>
        This Research describes study of the vulnerability reports in the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) database by using topic modeling on the description texts of the vulnerabilities. Prevalent vulnerability types were found, and new trends of vulnerabilities were discovered by studying the 121,716 unique CVE entries that are reported from January 1999 to July 2019
        <br><br>
        In this research we present a method for analyzing the vulnerabilities reported in CVE database using topic modeling. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was implemented to analyze large corpora of vulnerability texts in the CVE and find the prevalent topics in the CVE.
